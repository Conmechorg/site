            Why CM exists — and why the CCM is built the way it is. This is the personal hook, but also the design constraint:
            <strong>make cognition describable as mechanism</strong>, and make its limits explicit.

          <p class="panel-text">
            CM began after a 2019 road traffic collision and subsequent post-concussion / mild traumatic brain injury.
            The lived experience wasn’t “mystery” — it was a sudden, practical loss of capacity: shortened temporal horizon,
            reduced complexity handling, and difficulty articulating what had changed.
          </p>
          <p class="panel-text">
            The CCM language (H: temporal horizon, K: structural capacity) is partly a response to that: a way to describe
            cognitive limits without metaphors, and without over-claim.

                A side-impact collision resulted in head impact and lasting cognitive disruption.
                The problem wasn’t just symptoms — it was lack of vocabulary to describe <em>what</em> had changed.

                Podcasts and brain-injury material provided terms that made symptoms legible.
                Better articulation enabled better support, and reduced the “invisible” nature of the impairment.

                Years of systems design / architecture pushed the curiosity into a build impulse:
                if cognition is layered control, then we should be able to specify it as incremental mechanisms
                with boundaries, gates, and update rules.

                The model forms around a strict rule: start from whole-organism control problems and
                only add higher capability when lower levels cannot explain the observed behaviour.

              <p class="panel-text">
                Cognitive change is often described narratively. CM aims to provide a way to talk about
                capacity, limits, and recovery in mechanically grounded terms — without implying “mystical” gaps.

                If a capability can’t be specified in mechanism, it can’t be tested or falsified.
                CCM is built to be checkable — and conservative about what it claims.
